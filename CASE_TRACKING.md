   - Can add documents and notes
   - Can set deadlines

2. **Legal Aid Provider**
   - Can view and edit cases assigned to them

   - Can add documents, notes, and deadlines
   - Can share documents with clients

3. **Administrator**
   - Full access to all cases
   - Can assign cases to providers
   - Can configure system settings
   - Can generate reports

### Data Security

- All case data will be encrypted at rest
- Document storage will use secure cloud storage with access controls
- All API endpoints will require authentication
