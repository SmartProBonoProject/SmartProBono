      <p>To Whom It May Concern:</p>

      <p>I am writing in response to your {{#if is_first_contact}}initial communication, dated <span class="field">{{communication_date}}</span>,{{else}}recent attempts to collect a debt{{/if}} regarding the above-referenced account. Please be advised that I am disputing this debt and exercising my right to request validation pursuant to the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA), 15 U.S.C. ยง 1692g.</p>

      <p>Under the FDCPA, you are required to cease all collection activities until you provide me with verification of this debt. Accordingly, I request that you provide the following information:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Complete documentation showing that you are the legal owner of this debt and have the legal authority to collect it;</li>
        <li>A copy of the original agreement that created this debt, including my signature;</li>

          <ul>
            <li>The original amount of the debt;</li>
            <li>The date the debt was incurred;</li>
            <li>All charges, interest, and fees added to the debt;</li>
            <li>All payments made on the debt;</li>
            <li>An explanation of how the current amount was calculated;</li>

      <p>In addition to the above, I specifically dispute this debt for the following reasons:</p>
      <p><span class="field">{{specific_disputes}}</span></p>
      {{/if}}

      <p>Please note that this is not a refusal to pay, but a request for validation of this debt. I have the right to dispute this debt and request validation during the 30-day period following my receipt of your initial communication. Until you provide the requested validation, you should treat this debt as disputed.</p>

      <p>Be advised that I am familiar with my rights under the FDCPA and the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA). I know that:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>You must cease collection activities until you provide verification of the debt;</li>
        <li>You must not report this debt to the credit bureaus while it is in dispute, or if you do, you must note that it is disputed;</li>
        <li>You must not contact me at inconvenient times or places, such as before 8 a.m. or after 9 p.m.;</li>
        <li>If I request in writing that you cease communication, you must stop contacting me except to inform me of specific actions.</li>
      </ul>

      {{#if cease_communication}}
      <p>I hereby request that you cease all further communication with me except to comply with the verification requirement above or to inform me of your intent to take a specific action permitted by law.</p>
      {{/if}}

      <p>Please provide the requested validation information by mail to the address above. {{#if specify_electronic_communication}}Alternatively, you may provide this information electronically to <span class="field">{{email_address}}</span>.{{/if}}</p>

      <p>Any attempt to collect this debt or report it to a credit bureau without validating it violates the FDCPA and may entitle me to seek damages.</p>
