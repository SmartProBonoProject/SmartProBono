## Decision Making Process

SmartProBono uses a consensus-seeking decision-making process:

1. **Proposal**: Anyone can propose changes by creating an issue or pull request.

3. **Consensus Seeking**: Maintainers work to find a solution that addresses concerns.
4. **Decision**: Decisions are made based on consensus among maintainers.
5. **Implementation**: Once approved, changes are implemented and documented.

For technical decisions, the TSC has final authority. For legal content decisions, the Legal Advisory Board has final authority.
