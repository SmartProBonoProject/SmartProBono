# Multi-language Support Specification

## Overview

The multi-language support feature aims to make SmartProBono accessible to non-English speaking users by providing translations of the interface, legal content, and AI-generated responses. This document outlines the technical implementation plan, timeline, and considerations for this feature.

## Goals

1. Remove language barriers for accessing legal assistance
2. Serve diverse communities with varying language needs
3. Support accurate legal translations considering jurisdictional context
4. Provide a seamless user experience regardless of language choice

## Target Languages (Phase 1)

Initial implementation will focus on three high-priority languages:

1. **Spanish** - High demand in the US legal aid community
2. **French** - Serves Canadian markets and international users
3. **Mandarin Chinese** - Reaches large immigrant communities

## Phase 2 Languages (planned for Q3 2025)

1. Vietnamese
2. Korean
3. Russian
4. Arabic
5. Tagalog
6. Portuguese
7. Haitian Creole

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend Internationalization

We will implement i18n (internationalization) using the following approach:

```javascript
// Example using react-i18next
import { useTranslation } from 'react-i18next';

function LegalInfoComponent() {
  const { t } = useTranslation();
  
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{t('legal.rights.title')}</h1>
      <p>{t('legal.rights.description')}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

#### Key Components

1. **Language Selection UI**
   - Language dropdown in the navigation header
   - Language preference stored in user settings
   - Automatic language detection based on browser settings

2. **Translation Files**
   - JSON-based translation files for each language
   - Namespace organization by feature areas
   - Version control for translation updates

3. **Right-to-Left (RTL) Support**
   - CSS adaptations for RTL languages (Arabic)
   - Bi-directional text handling
   - UI component adaptation for RTL layout

### Backend Translation Services

The backend will support multi-language features through:

1. **Content Translation API**
   - Endpoints for retrieving translated static content
   - Database schema for storing multi-language content
   - Version control for translated legal information

2. **Dynamic Translation Pipeline**
   - Integration with machine translation APIs
   - Human review workflow for legal translations
   - Caching system for frequently translated content

3. **AI Response Localization**
   - Language-specific prompts for AI models
   - Training on multi-language legal corpora
   - Jurisdiction-aware response generation

### Database Schema

Content will be stored using a flexible schema:

```sql
CREATE TABLE legal_content (
  content_id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  content_type VARCHAR(50),
  jurisdiction VARCHAR(50),
  created_at TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE legal_content_translations (
  translation_id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  content_id UUID REFERENCES legal_content(content_id),
  language_code VARCHAR(10),
  title TEXT,
  content TEXT,
  is_machine_translated BOOLEAN,
  is_reviewed BOOLEAN,
  translator_id UUID,
  reviewed_by UUID,
  created_at TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

## Translation Workflow

1. **Content Creation**
   - Content initially created in English
   - Tagged with jurisdiction and content type
   - Marked for translation priority

2. **Machine Translation**
   - Automated first-pass translation via API
   - Quality scoring for machine translations
   - Flagging of legal terms requiring review

3. **Expert Review**
   - Legal experts review machine translations
   - Corrections applied and stored
   - Quality metrics tracked for improvement

4. **Publication**
   - Approved translations published to production
   - Version history maintained
   - User feedback mechanism for translation quality

## Language-Specific Considerations

### Legal Terminology Database

We will develop a database of legal terms and their translations:

1. Jurisdiction-specific legal terminology
2. Common legal phrases and their equivalents
3. Legal concepts that may not have direct translations

### Cultural Adaptations

Beyond translation, cultural adaptations will include:

1. Appropriate examples relevant to the language community
2. Cultural context for legal concepts
3. Jurisdiction-specific references and authorities

## Implementation Timeline

### Q4 2024
- Infrastructure setup for i18n
- UI components for language selection
- Spanish translation of core interface

### Q1 2025
- Spanish translation of legal content
- Machine translation pipeline implementation
- Expert review workflow setup

### Q2 2025
- French and Mandarin translations
- RTL support implementation
- Legal terminology database (v1)

## Testing Strategy

1. **Automated Testing**
   - Unit tests for i18n functionality
   - Integration tests for translation APIs
   - UI tests with different language settings

2. **Human Review**
   - Native speaker testing for each language
   - Legal expert verification of translations
   - Usability testing with target language users

3. **Performance Testing**
   - Load testing for translation services
   - Caching effectiveness measurement
   - Page load times with different languages

## Success Metrics

We will measure the success of the multi-language feature by tracking:

1. **Usage Metrics**
   - Percentage of users selecting non-English languages
   - Session duration for non-English users
   - Task completion rates by language

2. **Quality Metrics**
   - Translation accuracy scores
   - User-reported translation issues
   - Expert review ratings

3. **Impact Metrics**
   - Growth in non-English speaking users
   - Legal outcomes for non-English users
   - Community feedback from language communities
